    <p>
      Android application development involves several key components that work together to create a cohesive user
      experience. Understanding these building blocks is essential for developers to create successful Android apps.
    </p>

    <!-- User Interface -->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h3>User Interface (UI)</h3>
        <p>
          UI components are the visual elements that users interact with. These include <span
            class="important-point">activities</span>, <span class="important-point">fragments</span>, <span
            class="important-point">layouts</span>, <span class="important-point">widgets</span>, and resources like
          images and strings. <span class="important-point">Activities</span> represent individual screens with which
          users interact, while <span class="important-point">fragments</span> are reusable UI components within
          <span class="important-point">activities</span>. <span class="important-point">Layouts</span> define the
          structure of the UI, and <span class="important-point">widgets</span> are UI elements like buttons, text
          fields, and images.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Application Components -->
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h3>Application Components</h3>
        <p>
          Android applications are composed of several components, each with a distinct role. These components include
          <span class="important-point">activities</span>, <span class="important-point">services</span>, <span
            class="important-point">broadcast receivers</span>, and <span class="important-point">content
            providers</span>. <span class="important-point">Activities</span> represent the user interface and handle
          user interactions. <span class="important-point">Services</span> perform background tasks without a user
          interface. <span class="important-point">Broadcast receivers</span> respond to system-wide broadcast
          announcements. <span class="important-point">Content providers</span> manage shared data between
          applications.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Development Tools -->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h3>Development Tools</h3>
        <p>
          Android Studio is the official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android app development. It
          provides a comprehensive set of tools for designing, coding, debugging, and testing applications. Android
          Studio includes features like a visual layout editor, code editor, debugger, and emulator for testing apps on
          virtual devices.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Backend Services -->
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h3>Backend Services</h3>
        <p>
          Many Android applications rely on backend services to store data, perform computations, and handle
          communication with servers. These backend services may include databases, web services, APIs, and cloud
          infrastructure. Integration with backend services allows Android apps to access and manipulate data stored
          remotely, enabling features like user authentication, data synchronization, and real-time updates.
