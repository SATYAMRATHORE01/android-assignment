    <p>
      An Android activity goes through several stages during its lifetime, known as the Activity life cycle. Each
      stage offers different methods for developers to manage the state and behavior of their activities.
    </p>

    <h3>Seven Steps in Activity Life Cycle:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><span class="important-point">onCreate():</span> The system calls this method when creating the activity. It
        is the first callback received by an activity, and it is here that initialization is done, such as inflating the
        layout and initializing variables.</li>
      <li><span class="important-point">onStart():</span> Called when the activity is becoming visible to the user. At
        this point, the activity is not yet visible.</li>
      <li><span class="important-point">onResume():</span> Called when the activity will start interacting with the
        user. At this point, the activity is at the top of the activity stack and is visible and interacting with the
        user.</li>
      <li><span class="important-point">onPause():</span> Called when the activity is going into the background but has
        not been killed. It is a good place to commit unsaved changes or pause ongoing processes that should not
        continue while the user is not interacting with the app.</li>
      <li><span class="important-point">onStop():</span> Called when the activity is no longer visible to the user. This
        may happen because the activity is being destroyed, a new activity is starting, or the user is navigating
        away.</li>
      <li><span class="important-point">onDestroy():</span> The final call received before the activity is destroyed.
        This can happen either because the activity is finishing or because the system is temporarily destroying it to
        conserve resources.</li>
    </ol>
