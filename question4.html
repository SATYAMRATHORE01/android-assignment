    <p>
      <span class="important-point">Logcat</span> is a debugging tool in Android development used to view system and
      application logs. It provides developers with a way to monitor messages from various sources, including system
      messages, application messages, and messages from other devices connected to the Android Debug Bridge (ADB).
    </p>

    <h3>Key Features of Logcat:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="important-point">Logging Levels:</span> Logcat supports different logging levels, including
        verbose, debug, info, warning, error, and assert. Developers can filter messages based on these levels to focus
        on specific types of logs.</li>
      <li><span class="important-point">Tagging:</span> Developers can add custom tags to their log messages, making it
        easier to identify messages from specific components or modules of their application.</li>
      <li><span class="important-point">Filtering:</span> Logcat allows developers to filter messages based on tags,
        logging levels, and other criteria. This helps in isolating relevant messages and reducing noise in the log
        output.</li>
      <li><span class="important-point">Real-Time Monitoring:</span> Developers can view log messages in real-time as
        their application runs on a device or emulator. This enables them to monitor the behavior of their application
        and diagnose issues as they occur.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Usage Example:</h3>
    <div class="code-snippet">
      <pre>
<code>
// Example usage of Logcat in Android development
Log.d("MainActivity", "onCreate: Activity created");
Log.e("MainActivity", "onError: Something went wrong");
</code>
      </pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      In the above code snippet, <code>Log.d()</code> is used to log a debug message with the tag "MainActivity", and
      <code>Log.e()</code> is used to log an error message with the same tag.
    </p>
